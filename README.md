### Project Description
To Develop a data pipeline that ingests data from OSDC dataset and perform simple transformations on the ingested data using Hadoop and Spark separately. Using this pipeline as a model, we perform parameters tuning for Hadoop & Spark to study their performance based on these values. We provide the optimum parameter value for the given dataset.

### Deliverables
1. **Load Data into S3**: Download and upload the big dataset into a S3 bucket.
2. **Data pipeline**: Build two data pipelines, one using Hadoop and another using Spark. Both performing a simple transformation on the input data.
3. **Optimized pipeline**: Finetune the parameters for both the pipelines and report the optimized set of values.
